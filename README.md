MIDI parser
===========

## Goal
It is just a quick and dirty python script that converts a MIDI file into a CSV
file. The notes are described by their frequency, the time when they start and
their duration.

## Purpose
I use it to easily play music on Arduino chips with a buzzer without having to
parse a file onboard.
